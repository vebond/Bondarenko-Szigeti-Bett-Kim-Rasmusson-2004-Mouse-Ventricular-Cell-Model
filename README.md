# Bondarenko-Szigeti-Bett-Kim-Rasmusson-2004-Mouse-Ventricular-Cell-Model

This repository contains original program code written using Intel FORTRAN 90 that run under Linux (Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu) and generated data for paper Bondarenko VE, Szigeti GP, Bett GCL, Kim SJ, Rasmusson RL. Computer model of action potential of mouse ventricular myocytes. Am. J. Physiol. 287: H1378-H1403 (2004).
Program code needs to be compiled by the following command line:
ifort -o m9a -O3 -i4 -r8 m9a.f
for the model for apical ventricular myocytes.
